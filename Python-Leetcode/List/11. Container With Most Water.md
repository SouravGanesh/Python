# 11. Container With Most Water

## Problem Description
https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/
###
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

## Solution 1: using 2 pointer, greedy
### Python 3
```
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        i = 0
        j = len(height)-1
        maxarea = float('-inf')
        while i<j:
            area = 0
            short = min(height[i], height[j])
            area = short*(j-i)
            if area> maxarea:
                maxarea = area
            if height[i]< height[j]:
                i = i+1
            else:
                j = j-1
        return maxarea

        
```
