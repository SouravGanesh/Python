# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Problem Description
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/
###
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

## Solution 1: 5314 ms run time
### Python 3
```
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums_set = set(nums)
        count_max =0
        for num in nums:
            if num-1 not in nums_set:
                start = num
                count = 1
                while start+1 in nums_set:
                    count = count +1
                    start = start+1
                
                count_max = max(count, count_max)
            
        return count_max

```

## Solution 2: 314 ms run time
### Python 3
```
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:  
        set_nums = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for num in set_nums:
            if (num-1) not in set_nums:
                length = 1
                while (num + length) in set_nums:
                    length += 1
                if length > longest:
                    longest = length
        return longest
        
```
