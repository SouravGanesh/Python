# 455. Assign Cookies

## Problem Description
https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/
###
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

## Solution 1: greedy, sort, 2 pointer
### Python 3
```
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        # Sort the arrays
        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        
        # Initialize count for tracking assignments of cookies
        count = 0
        # Initialize two pointers i and j to iterate on g and s
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        # Iterate through the arrays
        while i < len(g) and j < len(s):
            # If the size of the cookie is greater than or equal to the child's greed,
            # assign the cookie to the child and move both pointers
            if g[i] <= s[j]:
                count += 1
                i += 1
            # Move the cookie pointer to the next cookie, regardless of assignment
            j += 1
        
        return count

        
```

## Solution 2: greedy, sort
### Python 3
```
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        
        
        g.sort(reverse=True)
        s.sort(reverse=True)

        ind = 0
        max_s = 0

        for ele in g:
            if ind == len(s):
                return max_s
            if s[ind]>=ele:
                ind += 1
                max_s += 1
        
        return max_s
```
