# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

## Problem Description
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/
###
You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.
 

## Solution 1: 
### Python 3
```
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        max_len = 0
        max_count = 0
        count = {}

        for right in range(len(s)):
            count[s[right]] = count.get(s[right], 0) + 1
            max_count = max(max_count, count[s[right]])

            # If the current window size minus the count of the most frequent character
            # is greater than k, shrink the window from the left
            if (right - left + 1) - max_count > k:
                count[s[left]] -= 1
                left += 1

            # Update the maximum length of the current window
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

        return max_len
```
