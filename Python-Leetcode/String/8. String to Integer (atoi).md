# 8. String to Integer (atoi)

## Problem Description
https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/
###
Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity is neither present.
Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
Edge case: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.

## Solution 1
### Python 3
```
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        is_positive = True
        s = s.lstrip()
        if not s:
            return res
        i = 0
        if s[0] == '+': 
            i = 1
        elif s[0] == '-':
            i = 1
            is_positive = False
        while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():
            res = res * 10 + int(s[i])
            i += 1
        res = -res if not is_positive else res
        if res > (2**31)-1:
            res = (2**31)-1
        elif res < (-2**31):
            res = (-2**31)
        return res
        
```
